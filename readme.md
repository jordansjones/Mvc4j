# Mvc4j

Mvc4j is a Java port of the [Asp.Net MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc) web framework. _Note: this isn't even a developer preview. This port is an ongoing process and it is not recommended for even hypothetical use._

I am currently refactoring/upgrading to [Asp.Net MVC 4](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/). I expect this to take quite a bit of time.
